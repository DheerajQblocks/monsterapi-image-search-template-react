# React Image Search App Template

This is a simple React template for building an image search application using React. It allows users to search for images using a search query, and the images are displayed in a list.

## Features

- Search for images based on keywords.
- Display a list of images.
- Easily customize and extend the template to add more features.

## Usage

To create a new project based on this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   cd react-image-search-template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

3. Implement Your Image Search API:

   - Open the `src/App.js` file.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your image search app in action.
